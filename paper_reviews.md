# Meta-analysis of tumor- and T cell-intrinsic mechanisms of sensitization to checkpoint inhibition
PMID: [33508232](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33508232/)

First and last authors: Kevin Litchfield, Charles Swanton
##### Main points
1. CPI1000+: 1008 CPI-treated (CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1)tumors from 12 individual cohorts from 7 tumor types (met uorthelial, melanoma, HNSCC, NSCLC, RCC, CRC, BRCA)
2. Benchmarked 55 biomarkers across 723 articles (includes TMB, tobacco mut, UV sig, etc). Z score standardized mutations and expression for comparison.
3. Clonal TMB strongest biomarker (estimated per cell mutation #)
4. All measured biomarkers only account for 60% of the variation, so 40% left undiscovered.
5. XGBoost to derive single score of biomarkers that achieved significance (11). Compared score to FDA-approved TMB biomarker. 3 test cohorts not in CPI1000+. Better AUC across all test cohorts compared to TMB.
6. CXCL9 expression and clonal TMB performs better than TMB alone.
7. COSMIC mutational signatures v2: 1A_aging, 4_tobacco, 7_UV, 10_POLE, 2_13_APOBEC were significant
8. Loss of 9q34 was associated with sensitization - TRAF2 gene is important. Selective pressure comes from other genes on chr9, including CDKN2A
9. CCND1 amplification associated with CPI resistance
